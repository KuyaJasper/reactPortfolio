# Development

For development of this project, I used [React](https://reactjs.org/)

I did CSS styling with [Styled Componenets](https://styled-components.com/), which allowed me to keep all the styling and the JSX code in one file, instead of referencing multiple.

# Acceptance Criteria

```md
* Updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects

* Use React

* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects

* Deploy this site to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)
```
